It uses a cloud computing algorithm to analyze frequently updated satellite imagery along with complementary information on factors that affect tree cover loss, such as fires and precipitation. The system generates twice-monthly "alerts" for the world’s [humid tropical forests](http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf) that identify 500 x 500 meter areas where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred.

FORMA is designed for quick identification of new areas of tree cover loss. The system analyzes data gathered daily by the [MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) sensor, which operates on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php), a measure of vegetation greenness. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are likely to indicate forest being cleared, burned, or defoliated.

FORMA alerts only appear in areas where the probability of tree cover loss is greater than or equal to 50%.

Upcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 x 250 meters, and expanding coverage to tropical dry forest and eventually to other biomes across the globe.

Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.

Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.

Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A "gr" in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:

-Large industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares
-Mosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use
-Mosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.

The first step was a per-pixel classification of areas with tree canopy cover of 30% and above for the 2000 reference year. A second per-pixel classification procedure was performed to separate primary forest from other tree cover for 2000; contiguous areas of 5 ha and greater were retained as primary forest. A limited editing of this classification was performed to remove older plantations and adjust other forest formations that could not be identified using the per-pixel classifier, but could be identified in photo-interpretive contexts. Primary forests were subsequently characterized into primary intact and primary degraded subclasses using the GIS-based buffering approach of the Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL). To create the IFL layer, buffers of roads, settlements and other signs of human landscape alteration were used to identify degraded areas within zones of primary forest cover. IFL mapping employed cloud-free Landsat mosaics to quantify changes in primary intact forest extent. The map of primary intact and primary degraded forest cover types corresponds to the Indonesia Ministry of Forestry’s primary and secondary forest cover types.', 'Title': 'Primary Forests', 'Source': 'Landsat', 'Frequency of Updates': '', 'Translated Overview': '', 'Translated_Title': '', 'Resolution': '30 x 30 meters', 'Geographic Coverage': 'Indonesia', 'Date of Content': '2000'}, 'mys_oil_palm': {'Function': 'Shows the coverage of oil palm concessions in Sarawak, where information is available', 'Cautions': 'This map is known to be incomplete and some of the boundaries imprecise.

These maps allow for the co-location of biomass estimates with Hansen et al. (2013, v1.0) tree cover loss estimates at similar spatial resolution. The statistical relationship derived between ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and co-located Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics as described by Baccini et al. (2012) were used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics. Then, using randomForest models, the GLAS-derived estimates of biomass density were correlated to continuous, gridded variables including Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products (e.g., reflectance), elevation, and biophysical variables. By using continuous gridded datasets as inputs to the randomForest models, a wall-to-wall 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics was produced as well as the associated uncertainty layer. The uncertainty layer takes into account the errors from allometric equations, LiDAR based model, and randomForest model. All the errors are propagated to the final biomass estimate.

Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.

Voluntary and secure, the NCED respects landowner privacy and will not collect landowner names or sensitive information.

The Brazilian government uses these figures to establish public policy, including defining access to credit in the Amazon biome, establishing deforestation reduction goals, and soliciting funds to reduce deforestation. PRODES historically used Landsat 5 images, but now also incorporates imagery from Landsat 7 and 8, CBERS-2, CBERS-2B, Resourcesat-1, and UK2-DMC. PRODES is operated by the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) and the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). Since 2002, all PRODES data is publicly available online.

Input images for each of the 220 Landsat footprints that cover the Brazilian Amazon are selected based on their lack of cloud cover and their capture date. The PRODES system uses the seasonal year, starting on August 1st, to calculate annual deforestation, so images are selected as near to this date as possible (generally from July, August, and September). From 2003 to 2005, analysts used image transformation to determine the components of vegetation, soil, and shadow using the program SPRING. These components were segmented and classified into the classes of forest, non-forest, deforestation in the target year, previous deforestation, clouds, and water, which are then manually corrected by experts. Starting in 2005, a new methodology was implemented which makes use of the open source TerraAmazon platform. The platform allows the PRODES analysis to be more uniform and can incorporate imagery from a variety of satellites. As before, images are selected to be as cloud free as possible. The images are then masked to exclude non-forest, previous deforestation, and water using the previous year’s analysis. Analysts then delineate deforested polygons in the intact forest of the previous year. More information on the methodology can be found on the [PRODES website](http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/index.php).

There are also thousands of artisanal miners recovering gold and gemstones, often on a seasonal or part-time basis. There is no industrial-scale extraction of minerals, although many exploration licenses have been granted to mining companies and some have reported promising finds of gold. The mining law states that all mining in "national cultural, historical and heritage sites" is prohibited, and mining activities in "protected, reserved or restricted" areas can only be carried out with written permission of the authority responsible. The 2002 Law on Forestry allows mining within the permanent forest estate, however, any proposed mining operation must be the subject of a ‘prior study-evaluation’ by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The legality of mining operations on lands traditionally managed by indigenous people requires clarification.

These areas are divided in three categories of use: indirect use, direct use, and reserved zone.


Areas of indirect use

In indirect areas, the extraction of natural resources or other types of environmental modification are not allowed. These areas only permit non-manipulative scientific investigation and tourist, recreational, educational, and cultural activities under regulated conditions. The following are indirect use areas:

National Parks: created in areas that represent the large ecological units in the country. In these areas, SERNANP protects the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems, the associations of wild plants and animals, successional and evolutionary processes, as well as landscape and cultural characteristics. In this areas, hunting, ranching, farming, timber, or mining activities, or any activity that exploits natural resources, cannot be developed.

National Sanctuaries: areas where the habitat of a species or a community of flora or fauna is protected, as natural formations of scientific interest and national importance.

Historical Sanctuaries: areas that in addition to protecting natural values, show the the monumental and archaeological heritage of the country, or are areas where outstanding historical events took place.


Areas of direct use

In direct use areas, the use of natural resources is allowed, primarily by local people, under the guidelines of a Management Plan approved and supervised by the relevant national authority. The following are direct use areas:

National Reserves: areas dedicated to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including commercial use, of wild flora and fauna under management plans, with the exception of commercial forest use for timber

Landscape Reserves: areas where environments with geographical integrity are protected, housing important natural, cultural, and aesthetic values. If the prior zonification allows it, these areas can permit traditional use of natural resources, scientific investigation, tourism, and human settlements. Activities that cause notable changes in the landscape and the value of the area are excluded

Protected Forests: areas that are established to protect important watersheds, the banks of rivers and other water bodies, and stop erosion of fragile lands. In this areas, the use of resources and the development of activities are allowed, provided that those activities do not affect vegetation cover, fragile soils, or water flow.

Communal Reserves: areas dedicated to the conservation of wild flora and fauna for the benefit of neighboring rural people who are using resources traditionally. The use and commercialization of resources is done under management plans, approved and supervised by the government authority and conducted by the beneficiary populations.

Hunting Preserves: areas dedicated to the use of wild fauna through the regulated practice of sport hunting.

Wildlife Refuges: areas that require active intervention to guarantee the maintenance and recuperation of habitats and populations of particular species. These areas exclude commercial use of natural resources that could significantly change the habitat.


Reserved Zones:

In addition to the above categories, Reserved Zones are established as a transitory category in areas that have the conditions necessary to be considered as a natural protected area, but that require additional study to determine their extension and category, among other things.', 'Title': 'Peru national protected areas', 'Source': '[Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (SERNANP)](http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/sernanp/)', 'Frequency of Updates': 'Updated when a national protected area is modified or established.', 'Translated Overview': 'Esta capa muestra aquellas áreas protegidas administrado por el gobierno nacional, bajo la jurisdicción del Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (SERNANP). Estas áreas son divididas en tres categorías de uso: uso indirecto, uso directo, y zona reservada.


Áreas de uso indirecto

Las áreas de uso indirecto son aquellas de protección intangible, en las que no se permite la extracción de recursos naturales y ningún tipo de modificación del ambiente natural. Estas áreas solo permiten la investigación científica no manipulativa y actividades turísticas, recreativas, educativas y culturales bajo condiciones debidamente reguladas. Son áreas de uso indirecto:

Parques nacionales: creados en áreas que constituyen muestras representativas de las grandes unidades ecológicas del país. En ellos se protege la integridad ecológica de uno o más ecosistemas, las asociaciones de flora y fauna silvestre, los procesos sucesionales y evolutivos, así como características paisajísticas y culturales. En ellos no se pueden desarrollar actividades cinegéticas, ganaderas, pastoriles, madereras o mineras, o en general todas aquéllas que supongan la explotación de los recursos naturales.

Santuarios nacionales: áreas donde se protege el hábitat de una especie o una comunidad de flora y fauna, así como formaciones naturales de interés científico y paisajístico y de importancia nacional.

Santuarios históricos:áreas que además de proteger espacios que contienen valores naturales relevantes, constituyen el entorno de muestras del patrimonio monumental y arqueológico del país o son lugares donde se desarrollaron hechos sobresalientes de la historia nacional.


Áreas de uso directo

Son aquellas que permiten el aprovechamiento de recursos naturales, prioritariamente por las poblaciones locales, bajo los lineamientos de un Plan de Manejo aprobado y supervisado por la autoridad nacional competente. Son áreas de uso directo:

Reservas Nacionales: áreas destinadas a la conservación de la diversidad biológica y la utilización sostenible, incluso comercial, de los recursos de flora y fauna silvestre bajo planes de manejo, con excepción de las actividades de aprovechamiento forestal comercial con fines madereros.

Reservas Paisajísticas: áreas donde se protege ambientes cuya integridad geográfica muestra una relación armoniosa entre el hombre y la naturaleza, albergando por ello importantes valores naturales, culturales y estéticos. Si la zonificación del área así lo prevé, pueden permitirse el uso tradicional de recursos naturales, los usos científicos y turísticos y los asentamientos humanos. Las actividades que signifiquen cambios notables en las características del paisaje y los valores del área están excluidas.

Bosques de Protección: áreas que se establecen para proteger las cuencas altas o colectoras, las riberas de los ríos y de otros cursos de agua y, en general, para proteger contra la erosión a las tierras frágiles que así lo requieran. En ellos se permite el uso de recursos y el desarrollo de actividades que no afecten la cobertura vegetal, los suelos frágiles o cursos de agua.

Reservas Comunales: áreas destinadas a la conservación de la flora y fauna silvestre en beneficio de las poblaciones rurales vecinas las cuales, por realizar un uso tradicional comprobado, tienen preferencia en el uso de los recursos del área. El uso y comercialización de recursos se hace bajo planes de manejo, aprobados y supervisados por la autoridad y conducidos por los mismos beneficiarios.

Cotos de Caza: son áreas destinadas al aprovechamiento de la fauna silvestre a través de la práctica regulada de la caza deportiva.
Refugios de Vida Silvestre: áreas que requieren intervención activa para garantizar el mantenimiento y recuperación de hábitats y poblaciones de determinadas especies. Se excluyen el aprovechamiento comercial de recursos naturales que puedan provocar alteraciones significativas del hábitat.

- At least 70% of the original natural vegetation has been lost

When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions.

The names used were the most common and popular in general associated with the predominant type of vegetation or relief, as in the case of Pantanal biome, which is the highest provincial flooded surface of the world.

The Amazon Biome is defined by the climatic region, forest physiognomy and geographic location. The Atlantic Forest biome, which occupies the entire Brazilian continental east Atlantic coast and stretches inland in the Southeast and South, is defined by the predominant forest vegetation and diverse relief. The Pampa, restricted to Rio Grande do Sul, is defined by a set of field vegetation in plain relief. The predominant vegetation in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, second in size, extends from the Maranhão coast to the Midwest and the Caatinga Biome, typical of semi-arid climate of the northeastern backlands.

The data has 33% omission errors, though most of these occur in secondary forests where tree cover and other vegetation are more difficult to distinguish. Omission errors in primary forests fall to 17% when excluding pixels on the boundaries of other loss, suggesting that most of the omissions happen on the edges of loss patches.

While most existing loss alert products use 250-meter resolution MODIS imagery, these alerts have a 30-meter resolution and thus can detect loss at a much finer spatial scale. The alerts are currently operational for Peru, the Republic of Congo, and Kalimantan in Indonesia, and will eventually be expanded to the rest of the humid tropics.

New Landsat 7 and 8 images are downloaded as they are posted online at USGS EROS, assessed for cloud cover or poor data quality, and compared to the three previous years of Landsat-derived metrics (including ranks, means, and regressions of red, infrared and shortwave bands, and ranks of NDVI, NBR, and NDWI). The metrics and the latest Landsat image are run through seven decision trees to calculate a median probability of forest disturbance. Pixels with probability >50% are reported as tree cover loss alerts. Alerts remain unconfirmed until two or more out of four consecutive observations are labelled as tree cover loss.

Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.

Given the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.

Each polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A "gr" in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:

Large industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares
Mosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use
Mosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.
Clearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)

The 1993 Royal Decree on the Protection of Natural Areas recognized 23 protected areas, which at the time covered over 18% of Cambodia’s land area. The royal decree establishes four categories: national park, wildlife sanctuary, protected landscape, and multi-purpose (multiple use) areas necessary for the stability of the water, forestry, wildlife, and fisheries resource, for pleasure, and for the conservation of nature with a view of assuring economic development. In 2008, the Royal Government of Cambodia adopted the [Law on Protected Areas](http://www.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/pdf-viewer/?pdf=download/law/Law%20on%20Natural%20Protected%20Areas_February_15_2008_Khm.pdf) introducing and defining a new zoning system to manage the protected areas in Cambodia.

The law, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment, underlines the expansion and modification of protected areas categories which additionally include the Ramsar sites, biosphere reserves, natural heritage sites and marine parks. Since the Protected Areas Law was passed, numerous sub-decrees have been passed classifying areas as Sustainable Use Zones (degazettement). According to the law, after consulting with relevant ministries and institutions, local authorities, and local communities, the Government may permit development and investment activities in these zones. These activities can include infrastructure development, including irrigation and hydroelectricity projects, mining and resin exploitation.

This dataset contains data for five types of protected areas in Cambodia (national park, wildlife sanctuary, protected landscape, multiple use, Ramsar site) with issuing dates starting from 1993 to 2014.

The general objective of this project was to update the national forest cover map to the year 2006. The specific objectives included calculating the rates of land cover changes at national, departmental, and municipal scales and comparing the 2006 map to the 2001 map that was generated with the same methodology. The new methodology used to generate the 2006 map made it necessary to create a new 2001 map. To describe forest cover at the national scale, the use of information from remote sensing, whether satellite images or aerial photographs, represented the most accurate data source.

The elaboration of national maps of forest cover was based on satellite images from Landsat 5 and 7 as well as ASTER (only for the southwestern section of the country, in the area corresponding to the Landsat image of Path 21 Row 50). The forest cover for Guatemala in 2006 was estimated as 3,866,383 hectares, equivalent to 35.5% of the national territory. The revised value for 2001 is 4,152,051 hectares corresponding to 38.1% of the national territory. These values represent an annual net loss of 48,084 hectares, equivalent to a deforestation rate of - 1.16%.

Forest cover in 2010 for Guatemala was estimated at 3,722,595 hectares, equivalent to 34% of the national land territory. The value for forest cover for 2006, published in May of 2011, was revised and a new estimate of 3,868,708 hectares was obtained. These values represent a net loss of 146,112 hectares of forest, equivalent to a net deforestation rate of -1.0% per year at the national level (with respect to the total existing forest in 2006). The results show that the net rate of deforestation continues falling compared to previous studies (-1.43% for 1991-2001 and -1.16% for 2001-2006) as a result of substantial increases in forest cover gain. However, gross deforestation continues to increase, reaching an area of 132,137 hectares per year for the analyzed time period.

52% of the national forest cover is located inside the Guatemalan System of Protected Areas (SIGAP), which covers a third of the national territory. The remaining 48% of the forest cover is distributed in the other two thirds of the country.

[IUCN Management Categories](http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/)

Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](http://www.iucn.org/) defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.

As you click through protected areas in this layer, note the "legal designation" and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.

Ia. Strict Nature Reserves. Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation. Other common designations: Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve

Ib. Wilderness Areas. Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. Other common designations: Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area

II. National Parks. Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. Other common designations: State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park

III. National Monuments or Features. Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. Other common designations: Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden

IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas. Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. Other common designations: National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary

V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes. Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan. Other common designations: National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area

VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. Other common designations: Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve

[UNESCO-MAP Biosphere Reserves](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/): areas under UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme designated to "promote sustainable development based on local community efforts and sound science."

Over 35 times the size of Singapore, this majestic and ancient ecosystem covers more than 2.6 million hectares of lowland rainforests, peat swamps, montane and coastal forests and alpine meadows. Globally recognized as one of the richest expanses of tropical rainforest found anywhere in Southeast Asia, the Leuser Ecosystem is also one of Asia’s largest carbon sinks. The Leuser Ecosystem is the last place on earth where orangutans, rhinos, elephants, and tigers co-exist in the wild. All four of these species are now classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Critically Endangered. The Leuser Ecosystem is the only remaining habitat left in Sumatra large enough to sustain viable populations of these species. A publication in leading international journal Science listed the Leuser Ecosystem as "one of the world’s foremost irreplaceable areas."

The Leuser Ecosystem is an essential asset for the economic development of Aceh, providing a total economic value of at least 350 million US dollars per year. The Leuser Ecosystem acts as a life-support system for approximately four million people in Aceh. The primary ecosystem services are fresh water provision and disaster mitigation. The forests of the Leuser Ecosystem act as a sponge, soaking up the downpours of the rainy season and spreading out the release of water downstream more evenly across the months. Deforestation of this environmentally sensitive area is having a dramatic impact by increasing the damage caused by flooding and landslides, and causing economic damage to communities and downstream industry. Locally and globally, the Leuser Ecosystem also has immense environmental value due to its role in climate regulation and carbon storage. Efforts to conserve the Leuser Ecosystem date as far back as the early 19th century, when the traditional leaders of Aceh lobbied the colonial government to protect their natural heritage, ranging from the mountains all the way down to the coast. More recent laws have served to strengthen the protection of the Leuser Ecosystem and placed the responsibility for managing its protection and restoration with the Aceh Provincial Government (Article 150 of National Law on Governing Aceh No. 11/2006). Furthermore, the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh has special legal status as a National Strategic Area for its Environmental Protection Function (26 of 2007 juncto 26/2008), prohibiting any activities that reduce that function, including cultivation and infrastructure development.', 'Title': 'INDONESIA LEUSER ECOSYSTEM', 'Source': 'Digitization of JPEG of Ratification of Leuser Ecosystem boundary map, Ministry of Forestry decree 190/Kpts-II/2001 and 10193/Kpts-II/2002 (SK Menteri Kehutanan).', 'Frequency of Updates': '', 'Translated Overview': '', 'Translated_Title': '', 'Resolution': '', 'Geographic Coverage': 'Leuser Ecosystem', 'Date of Content': 'November 19, 2013'}, 'tree_cover_loss': {'Function': 'Identifies areas of gross tree cover loss ', 'Cautions': 'In this data set, "tree cover" is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. "Loss" indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, "loss" does not equate to deforestation. 

Due to variation in research methodology and date of content, tree cover, loss, and gain data sets cannot be compared accurately against each other. Accordingly, "net" loss cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover. 

The 2011-2014 data was produced using [updated methodology](http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.2.html). Comparisons between the original 2001-2010 data and the 2011-2014 update should be performed with caution.

The authors evaluated the overall prevalence of false positives (commission errors) in this data at 13%, and the prevalence of false negatives (omission errors) at 12%, though the accuracy varies by biome and thus may be higher or lower in any particular location. The model often misses disturbances in smallholder landscapes, resulting in lower accuracy of the data in sub-Saharan Africa, where this type of disturbance is more common. The authors are 75 percent confident that the loss occurred within the stated year, and 97 percent confident that it occurred within a year before or after. Users of the data can smooth out such uncertainty by examining the average over multiple years.

The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM), the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. Over 1 million satellite images were processed and analyzed, including over 600,000 Landsat 7 images for the 2000-2012 interval, and approximately 400,000 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images for updates for the 2011-2014 interval. The clear land surface observations in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss.

In this data set, "tree cover" is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. Tree cover loss is defined as "stand replacement disturbance," or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may be the result of human activities, including forestry practices such as timber harvesting or deforestation (the conversion of natural forest to other land uses), as well as natural causes such as disease or storm damage. Fire is another widespread cause of tree cover loss, and can be either natural or human-induced.

This data set has been updated twice since its creation, and now includes loss up to 2014 (Version 1.2). The analysis method has been modified in numerous ways, including new data for the target year, re-processed data for the previous two years (2011 and 2012 for the Version 1.1 update, 2012 and 2013 for the Version 1.2 update), and improved modelling and calibration. These modifications improve change detection for 2011-2014, including better detection of boreal loss due to fire, smallholder rotation agriculture in tropical forests, selective losing, and short cycle plantations. Eventually, a future "Version 2.0" will include reprocessing for 2000-2010 data, but in the meantime integrated use of the original data and Version 1.2 should be performed with caution. Read more about the Version 1.2 update [here](http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.2.html).

When zoomed out (< zoom level 13), pixels of loss are shaded according to the density of loss at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration of tree cover loss, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover loss. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (≥ zoom level 13).

The tree cover canopy density of the displayed data varies according to the selection - use the legend on the map to change the minimum tree cover canopy density threshold.

To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2000.

Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2013 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as "reduction in extent" met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.

This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. More information about the data set and methodology is available on www.intactforests.org
